## Overview

This project is a **web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** developed as part of my **internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  

It allows users to:  
- Play **Player vs Player**  
- Challenge a **computer AI** with **Easy** or **Hard difficulty** (powered by the Minimax algorithm)  
- Track scores in real-time  
- Enjoy **smooth animations** and **audio feedback**  
- Experience a **modern glassmorphism UI**  

This project demonstrates **problem-solving, frontend development skills, and AI logic implementation** in a real-world context.
